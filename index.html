    <div class="post"><p>I haven’t been writing because my blogging setup was broken. I was using <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> as my blogging framework then and it was fantastic. Gradually the ruby toolchain was upgraded and Octopress wasn’t maintained. I was stuck on using ruby 1.9.3(gasp!). Until one day, on my new machine, I couldn’t get the old setup to work without herculean effort. I never found the time to fix it until today where I found a few minutes. It is still a static site on Github pages and it still runs Jekyll. I still use Emacs for authoring it, and Git for my deployment workflow. Nothing’s changed very much and I have no desire to change things. I’m just glad to be writing again.</p>

    <div class="post"><p>Objectives, Key Result or OKR for short, is something I’ve came across from blogs and people. As I understood how OKRs help a company focus, I became intrigued. Staying focused is much easier said than done. When presented with choices, we often choose tasks that we like doing, the easiest or the most urgent, rather than the right thing that has the most impact. It is hard enough to do it on your own, let alone an organisation. In OKRs, I saw a system that can keep an organisation laser focused as it scales. I didn’t have a chance to implement it; until I co-founded <a href="https://www.propineglobal.com">Propine</a>. While there’re plenty of articles about what OKRs is, there aren’t much written from those who’ve practiced it. After two quarters of practicing OKRs, does it work?</p>

Conventional accelerators follow a process where they accept formed teams, spend 3 months preparing them for the Investor Day, following which the accelerator helps them with fund raising. EF don’t usually accept formed teams. Individuals join the program before they have an idea, form a team, validate an idea and get selected to join the second phase.</p>

React and Redux are not the first Javascript frameworks I’ve learnt; nor is it likely to be the last. We want <a href="https://blog.liangzan.net/blog/2018/01/12/things-i-would-do-at-a-new-startup/">something proven</a> and something that has a thriving eco-system surrounding it. At this moment(2018), we see 2 options - React or <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>. We decided that React with the potential to support mobile apps would be the sensible decision. React coupled with Redux gives us the structure for a modern Javascript application. Well, nothing is perfect. Let’s visit some of those aspects where I felt it ticked and where it didn’t for React with Redux.</p>

If <strong>Chef’s table</strong> is angled to show how good the chef was, how talented they are, I wonder, would the viewer relate personally to the chef?

    <div class="post"><p>My office has a Sophos UTM. It acts as a firewall for the office network. We also use it as a VPN server. It allows us to access the machines in the office network. More importantly, it allows remote users to access the servers. Our servers have access restricted to a white listed list of IP addresses. This way, we only open up the white list to the office network. This allows our people to work from anywhere. We don’t have to keep updating the white list of IP addresses. When I tried setting it up, I could not find articles documenting how to do it. Hopefully it will point you in the right direction.</p>

By standalone application, I mean that the application is packaged as a single file. It could be a jar file or an executable packaged from Java/Scala/C/Haskell/etc. In my case, it was a jar file. My server is Ubuntu 14.04. My automation tool is <a href="http://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> and a dash of shell scripts. The process is very much influenced by <a href="http://capistranorb.com/">Capistrano</a>, a tool that is very popular for deploying Ruby web applications. There are three aims. One, I want to deploy in one step. Two, I want to version my deployment. Three, it should cater for easy rolling back.</p>

Right now, my primry editor is Emacs. Not to say Vim is not good, but for Emacs fits my setup better. I’m typing this article on Emacs if you’re curious.
First a little history. I started with Vim first. Once I got through the steep learning curve, it felt fast. I was typing faster. Vim made me saw how inefficient I was earlier. From time to time, I will see articles or comments that mention Emacs. My curiosity grew. I started trying out Emacs. When I started learning it, I forced myself to use only emacs for a week. After that week, I was able to memorise most of the basic key strokes. So after about 2 years of using Emacs, I think its the right time to summarise my opinions.</p>
