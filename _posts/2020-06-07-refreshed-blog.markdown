I haven't been writing because my blogging setup was broken. I was using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) as my blogging framework then and it was fantastic. Gradually the ruby toolchain was upgraded and Octopress wasn't maintained. I was stuck on using ruby 1.9.3(gasp!). Until one day, on my new machine, I couldn't get the old setup to work without herculean effort. I never found the time to fix it until today where I found a few minutes. It is still a static site on Github pages and it still runs Jekyll. I still use Emacs for authoring it, and Git for my deployment workflow. Nothing's changed very much and I have no desire to change things. I'm just glad to be writing again.
